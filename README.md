## About the Project
I have always been interested in learning C++. I found it as a very challenging programming language with a steep learning curve, but I decided to try it out as I saw it could help me improve as a programmer and discover the potential in learning emulation and computer graphics. I decided to start with the Chip8 emulator because it is a simple system to emulate, and is the best way to show off my current knowledge in C++.

## What is Chip8?
Chip8 is a virtual machine that was created in the 1970s to allow video games to be more easily programmed for the computers of that time. It was never a real computer, but rather a virtual machine that ran on real computers. It was used to create simple games such as Pong, Tetris, and Space Invaders. It was also used to create simple drawing programs. The Chip8 virtual machine was never a real computer, but rather a virtual machine that ran on real computers.
